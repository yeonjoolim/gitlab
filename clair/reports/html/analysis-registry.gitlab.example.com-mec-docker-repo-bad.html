Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed configuration file /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-5425) * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed certain configuration files read by the Tomcat initialization script as writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-6325) * It was found that the expression language resolver evaluated expressions within a privileged code section. A malicious web application could use this flaw to bypass security manager protections. (CVE-2014-7810) * It was discovered that tomcat used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5388) * A session fixation flaw was found in the way Tomcat recycled the requestedSessionSSL field. If at least one web application was configured to use the SSL session ID as the HTTP session ID, an attacker could reuse a previously used session ID for further requests. (CVE-2015-5346) Red Hat would like to thank Dawid Golunski (http://legalhackers.com) for reporting CVE-2016-5425 and Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting CVE-2016-5388.

Security Fix(es): * A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat's handling of pipelined requests when "Sendfile" was used. If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647) * Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Tomcat where if a servlet context was configured with readonly=false and HTTP PUT requests were allowed, an attacker could upload a JSP file to that context and achieve code execution. (CVE-2017-12615, CVE-2017-12617) * A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat where the CORS Filter did not send a "Vary: Origin" HTTP header. This potentially allowed sensitive data to be leaked to other visitors through both client-side and server-side caches. (CVE-2017-7674)</div>

It was found that a fix for a previous security flaw introduced a regression that could cause a denial of service in Tomcat 7. A remote attacker could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of CPU on the Tomcat server by sending a specially crafted request to that server. (CVE-2014-0186) It was found that when Tomcat 7 processed a series of HTTP requests in which at least one request contained either multiple content-length headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding header, Tomcat would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests. (CVE-2013-4286) It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a denial of service flaw in the way Tomcat 7 processed chunk extensions and trailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could consume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Note that chunked transfer encoding is enabled by default. (CVE-2013-4322) All Tomcat 7 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.</div>

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own. (CVE-2016-6816) Note: This fix causes Tomcat to respond with an HTTP 400 Bad Request error when request contains characters that are not permitted by the HTTP specification to appear not encoded, even though they were previously accepted. The newly introduced system property tomcat.util.http.parser.HttpParser.requestTargetAllow can be used to configure Tomcat to accept curly braces ({ and }) and the pipe symbol (|) in not encoded form, as these are often used in URLs without being properly encoded.  * A bug was discovered in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector. This led to the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times allowing information leakage between requests including, and not limited to, session ID and the response body.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: tomcat (7.0.69). (BZ#1287928) Security Fix(es): * A CSRF flaw was found in Tomcat's the index pages for the Manager and Host Manager applications. These applications included a valid CSRF token when issuing a redirect as a result of an unauthenticated request to the root of the web application. This token could then be used by an attacker to perform a CSRF attack. (CVE-2015-5351) * It was found that several Tomcat session persistence mechanisms could allow a remote, authenticated user to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and execute arbitrary code in a privileged context via a web application that placed a crafted object in a session. (CVE-2016-0714) * A security manager bypass flaw was found in Tomcat that could allow remote, authenticated users to access arbitrary application data, potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0763) * A denial of service vulnerability was identified in Commons FileUpload that occurred when the length of the multipart boundary was just below the size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file if the boundary was the typical tens of bytes long. (CVE-2016-3092) * A directory traversal flaw was found in Tomcat's RequestUtil.java. A remote, authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and list a parent directory via a '/..' in a pathname used by a web application in a getResource, getResourceAsStream, or getResourcePaths call. (CVE-2015-5174) * It was found that Tomcat could reveal the presence of a directory even when that directory was protected by a security constraint. A user could make a request to a directory via a URL not ending with a slash and, depending on whether Tomcat redirected that request, could confirm whether that directory existed. (CVE-2015-5345) * It was found that Tomcat allowed the StatusManagerServlet to be loaded by a web application when a security manager was configured. This allowed a web application to list all deployed web applications and expose sensitive information such as session IDs.

(CVE-2014-0075) It was found that Apache Tomcat did not check for overflowing values when parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a Tomcat server located behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header correctly. (CVE-2014-0099) It was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet implementation in Apache Tomcat allowed the definition of XML External Entities (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this to circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0096) The CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security. All Tomcat 7 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.</div>

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: tomcat (7.0.76). (BZ#1414895) Security Fix(es): * The Realm implementations did not process the supplied password if the supplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration includes the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability harder. (CVE-2016-0762) * It was discovered that a malicious web application could bypass a configured SecurityManager via a Tomcat utility method that was accessible to web applications. (CVE-2016-5018) * It was discovered that when a SecurityManager was configured, Tomcat's system property replacement feature for configuration files could be used by a malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager and read system properties that should not be visible. (CVE-2016-6794) * It was discovered that a malicious web application could bypass a configured SecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration parameters for the JSP Servlet. (CVE-2016-6796) * It was discovered that it was possible for a web application to access any global JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been configured or not.

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed configuration file /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-5425) * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed certain configuration files read by the Tomcat initialization script as writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-6325) * It was found that the expression language resolver evaluated expressions within a privileged code section. A malicious web application could use this flaw to bypass security manager protections. (CVE-2014-7810) * It was discovered that tomcat used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5388) * A session fixation flaw was found in the way Tomcat recycled the requestedSessionSSL field. If at least one web application was configured to use the SSL session ID as the HTTP session ID, an attacker could reuse a previously used session ID for further requests.

If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647) * Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Tomcat where if a servlet context was configured with readonly=false and HTTP PUT requests were allowed, an attacker could upload a JSP file to that context and achieve code execution. (CVE-2017-12615, CVE-2017-12617) * A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat where the CORS Filter did not send a "Vary: Origin" HTTP header. This potentially allowed sensitive data to be leaked to other visitors through both client-side and server-side caches. (CVE-2017-7674)</div>

It was found that a fix for a previous security flaw introduced a regression that could cause a denial of service in Tomcat 7. A remote attacker could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of CPU on the Tomcat server by sending a specially crafted request to that server. (CVE-2014-0186) It was found that when Tomcat 7 processed a series of HTTP requests in which at least one request contained either multiple content-length headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding header, Tomcat would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests. (CVE-2013-4286) It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a denial of service flaw in the way Tomcat 7 processed chunk extensions and trailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could consume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Note that chunked transfer encoding is enabled by default. (CVE-2013-4322) All Tomcat 7 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.</div>

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own. (CVE-2016-6816) Note: This fix causes Tomcat to respond with an HTTP 400 Bad Request error when request contains characters that are not permitted by the HTTP specification to appear not encoded, even though they were previously accepted. The newly introduced system property tomcat.util.http.parser.HttpParser.requestTargetAllow can be used to configure Tomcat to accept curly braces ({ and }) and the pipe symbol (|) in not encoded form, as these are often used in URLs without being properly encoded.  * A bug was discovered in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector. This led to the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times allowing information leakage between requests including, and not limited to, session ID and the response body. (CVE-2016-8745)</div>

                                                <div>Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies. The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: tomcat (7.0.69). (BZ#1287928) Security Fix(es): * A CSRF flaw was found in Tomcat's the index pages for the Manager and Host Manager applications. These applications included a valid CSRF token when issuing a redirect as a result of an unauthenticated request to the root of the web application. This token could then be used by an attacker to perform a CSRF attack. (CVE-2015-5351) * It was found that several Tomcat session persistence mechanisms could allow a remote, authenticated user to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and execute arbitrary code in a privileged context via a web application that placed a crafted object in a session. (CVE-2016-0714) * A security manager bypass flaw was found in Tomcat that could allow remote, authenticated users to access arbitrary application data, potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0763) * A denial of service vulnerability was identified in Commons FileUpload that occurred when the length of the multipart boundary was just below the size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file if the boundary was the typical tens of bytes long. (CVE-2016-3092) * A directory traversal flaw was found in Tomcat's RequestUtil.java. A remote, authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and list a parent directory via a '/..' in a pathname used by a web application in a getResource, getResourceAsStream, or getResourcePaths call. (CVE-2015-5174) * It was found that Tomcat could reveal the presence of a directory even when that directory was protected by a security constraint. A user could make a request to a directory via a URL not ending with a slash and, depending on whether Tomcat redirected that request, could confirm whether that directory existed. (CVE-2015-5345) * It was found that Tomcat allowed the StatusManagerServlet to be loaded by a web application when a security manager was configured. This allowed a web application to list all deployed web applications and expose sensitive information such as session IDs.

It was discovered that Apache Tomcat did not limit the length of chunk sizes when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial of service attack against Tomcat by streaming an unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server resources. (CVE-2014-0075) It was found that Apache Tomcat did not check for overflowing values when parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a Tomcat server located behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header correctly. (CVE-2014-0099) It was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet implementation in Apache Tomcat allowed the definition of XML External Entities (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this to circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive information.

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the RMI registry and DCG implementations in the RMI component of OpenJDK performed deserialization of untrusted inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of RMI registry or a Java RMI application. (CVE-2017-3241) This issue was addressed by introducing whitelists of classes that can be deserialized by RMI registry or DCG. These whitelists can be customized using the newly introduced sun.rmi.registry.registryFilter and sun.rmi.transport.dgcFilter security properties. * Multiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries and Hotspot components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-3272, CVE-2017-3289) * A covert timing channel flaw was found in the DSA implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to extract certain information about the used key via a timing side channel. (CVE-2016-5548) * It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK accepted ECSDA signatures using non-canonical DER encoding. This could cause a Java application to accept signature in an incorrect format not accepted by other cryptographic tools. (CVE-2016-5546) * It was discovered that the 2D component of OpenJDK performed parsing of iTXt and zTXt PNG image chunks even when configured to ignore metadata. An attacker able to make a Java application parse a specially crafted PNG image could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2017-3253) * It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not validate the length of the object identifier read from the DER input before allocating memory to store the OID. An attacker able to make a Java application decode a specially crafted DER input could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2016-5547) * It was discovered that the JAAS component of OpenJDK did not use the correct way to extract user DN from the result of the user search LDAP query. A specially crafted user LDAP entry could cause the application to use an incorrect DN. (CVE-2017-3252) * It was discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK failed to properly parse user info from the URL. A remote attacker could cause a Java application to incorrectly parse an attacker supplied URL and interpret it differently from other applications processing the same URL. (CVE-2016-5552) * Multiple flaws were found in the Networking components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-3261, CVE-2017-3231) * A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183) This update mitigates the CVE-2016-2183 issue by adding 3DES cipher suites to the list of legacy algorithms (defined using the jdk.tls.legacyAlgorithms security property) so they are only used if connecting TLS/SSL client and server do not share any other non-legacy cipher suite.

An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10285, CVE-2017-10346) * It was discovered that the Kerberos client implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK used the sname field from the plain text part rather than encrypted part of the KDC reply message. A man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this flaw to impersonate Kerberos services to Java applications acting as Kerberos clients. (CVE-2017-10388) * It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK generated weak password-based encryption keys used to protect private keys stored in key stores. This made it easier to perform password guessing attacks to decrypt stored keys if an attacker could gain access to a key store. (CVE-2017-10356) * A flaw was found in the Smart Card IO component in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10274) * It was found that the FtpClient implementation in the Networking component of OpenJDK did not set connect and read timeouts by default. A malicious FTP server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to block execution of a Java application connecting to an FTP server. (CVE-2017-10355) * It was found that the HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection classes in the Networking component of OpenJDK failed to check for newline characters embedded in URLs. An attacker able to make a Java application perform an HTTP request using an attacker provided URL could possibly inject additional headers into the request. (CVE-2017-10295) * It was discovered that multiple classes in the JAXP, Serialization, Libraries, and JAX-WS components of OpenJDK did not limit the amount of memory allocated when creating object instances from the serialized form. A specially-crafted input could cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of memory when deserialized.

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check arguments of the System.arraycopy() function in certain cases. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to corrupt virtual machine's memory and completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5582) * It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check received Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to send debugging commands to a Java program running with debugging enabled if they could make victim's browser send HTTP requests to the JDWP port of the debugged application. (CVE-2016-5573) * It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not restrict the set of algorithms used for Jar integrity verification. This flaw could allow an attacker to modify content of the Jar file that used weak signing key or hash algorithm. (CVE-2016-5542) Note: After this update, MD2 hash algorithm and RSA keys with less than 1024 bits are no longer allowed to be used for Jar integrity verification by default. MD5 hash algorithm is expected to be disabled by default in the future updates. A newly introduced security property jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms can be used to control the set of disabled algorithms. * A flaw was found in the way the JMX component of OpenJDK handled classloaders. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5554) * A flaw was found in the way the Networking component of OpenJDK handled HTTP proxy authentication. A Java application could possibly expose HTTPS server authentication credentials via a plain text network connection to an HTTP proxy if proxy asked for authentication. (CVE-2016-5597) Note: After this update, Basic HTTP proxy authentication can no longer be used when tunneling HTTPS connection through an HTTP proxy. Newly introduced system properties jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes and jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes can be used to control which authentication schemes can be requested by an HTTP proxy when proxying HTTP and HTTPS connections respectively. Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.</div>

Security Fix(es): * Multiple flaws were found in the Hotspot and AWT components of OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-2582, CVE-2018-2641) * It was discovered that the LDAPCertStore class in the JNDI component of OpenJDK failed to securely handle LDAP referrals. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to make it fetch attacker controlled certificate data. (CVE-2018-2633) * The JGSS component of OpenJDK ignores the value of the javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly property when using HTTP/SPNEGO authentication and always uses global credentials. It was discovered that this could cause global credentials to be unexpectedly used by an untrusted Java application. (CVE-2018-2634) * It was discovered that the JMX component of OpenJDK failed to properly set the deserialization filter for the SingleEntryRegistry in certain cases. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass intended deserialization restrictions. (CVE-2018-2637) * It was discovered that the LDAP component of OpenJDK failed to properly encode special characters in user names when adding them to an LDAP search query. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to manipulate LDAP queries performed by the LdapLoginModule class. (CVE-2018-2588) * It was discovered that the DNS client implementation in the JNDI component of OpenJDK did not use random source ports when sending out DNS queries. This could make it easier for a remote attacker to spoof responses to those queries. (CVE-2018-2599) * It was discovered that the I18n component of OpenJDK could use an untrusted search path when loading resource bundle classes. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as another local user by making their Java application load an attacker controlled class file. (CVE-2018-2602) * It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK failed to sufficiently limit the amount of memory allocated when reading DER encoded input. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a Java application use an excessive amount of memory if it parsed attacker supplied DER encoded input. (CVE-2018-2603) * It was discovered that the key agreement implementations in the JCE component of OpenJDK did not guarantee sufficient strength of used keys to adequately protect generated shared secret. This could make it easier to break data encryption by attacking key agreement rather than the encryption using the negotiated secret. (CVE-2018-2618) * It was discovered that the JGSS component of OpenJDK failed to properly handle GSS context in the native GSS library wrapper in certain cases. A remote attacker could possibly make a Java application using JGSS to use a previously freed context. (CVE-2018-2629) * It was discovered that multiple classes in the Libraries, AWT, and JNDI components of OpenJDK did not sufficiently validate input when creating object instances from the serialized form. A specially-crafted input could cause a Java application to create objects with an inconsistent state or use an excessive amount of memory when deserialized. (CVE-2018-2663, CVE-2018-2677, CVE-2018-2678) * It was discovered that multiple encryption key classes in the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not properly synchronize access to their internal data. This could possibly cause a multi-threaded Java application to apply weak encryption to data because of the use of a key that was zeroed out. (CVE-2018-2579) Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.</div>

Security Fix(es): * An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639) Note: This is the OpenJDK side of the CVE-2018-3639 mitigation. Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting this issue.</div>

Security Fix(es): * An untrusted library search path flaw was found in the JCE component of OpenJDK. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause a Java application using JCE to load an attacker-controlled library and hence escalate their privileges. (CVE-2017-3511) * It was found that the JAXP component of OpenJDK failed to correctly enforce parse tree size limits when parsing XML document. An attacker able to make a Java application parse a specially crafted XML document could use this flaw to make it consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2017-3526) * It was discovered that the HTTP client implementation in the Networking component of OpenJDK could cache and re-use an NTLM authenticated connection in a different security context. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a Java application perform HTTP requests authenticated with credentials of a different user. (CVE-2017-3509) Note: This update adds support for the "jdk.ntlm.cache" system property which, when set to false, prevents caching of NTLM connections and authentications and hence prevents this issue. However, caching remains enabled by default. * It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not allow users to restrict the set of algorithms allowed for Jar integrity verification. This flaw could allow an attacker to modify content of the Jar file that used weak signing key or hash algorithm. (CVE-2017-3539) Note: This updates extends the fix for CVE-2016-5542 released as part of the RHSA-2016:2079 erratum to no longer allow the MD5 hash algorithm during the Jar integrity verification by adding it to the jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms security property. * Newline injection flaws were discovered in FTP and SMTP client implementations in the Networking component in OpenJDK. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to manipulate FTP or SMTP connections established by a Java application. (CVE-2017-3533, CVE-2017-3544) Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website. Bug Fix(es): * When a method is called using the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) "invokeMethod" command in a target Java virtual machine, JDWP creates global references for every Object that is implied in the method invocation, as well as for the returned argument of the reference type. Previously, the global references created for such arguments were not collected (deallocated) by the garbage collector after "invokeMethod" finished. This consequently caused memory leaks, and because references to such objects were never released, the debugged application could be terminated with an Out of Memory error. This bug has been fixed, and the described problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1442162)</div>

A flaw was found in the way Wget handled symbolic links. A malicious FTP server could allow Wget running in the mirror mode (using the '-m' command line option) to write an arbitrary file to a location writable to by the user running Wget, possibly leading to code execution. (CVE-2014-4877) Note: This update changes the default value of the --retr-symlinks option. The file symbolic links are now traversed by default and pointed-to files are retrieved rather than creating a symbolic link locally. Red Hat would like to thank the GNU Wget project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges HD Moore of Rapid7, Inc as the original reporter. All users of wget are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.</div>

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the RMI registry and DCG implementations in the RMI component of OpenJDK performed deserialization of untrusted inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of RMI registry or a Java RMI application. (CVE-2017-3241) This issue was addressed by introducing whitelists of classes that can be deserialized by RMI registry or DCG. These whitelists can be customized using the newly introduced sun.rmi.registry.registryFilter and sun.rmi.transport.dgcFilter security properties. * Multiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries and Hotspot components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-3272, CVE-2017-3289) * A covert timing channel flaw was found in the DSA implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to extract certain information about the used key via a timing side channel. (CVE-2016-5548) * It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK accepted ECSDA signatures using non-canonical DER encoding. This could cause a Java application to accept signature in an incorrect format not accepted by other cryptographic tools. (CVE-2016-5546) * It was discovered that the 2D component of OpenJDK performed parsing of iTXt and zTXt PNG image chunks even when configured to ignore metadata. An attacker able to make a Java application parse a specially crafted PNG image could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2017-3253) * It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not validate the length of the object identifier read from the DER input before allocating memory to store the OID. An attacker able to make a Java application decode a specially crafted DER input could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2016-5547) * It was discovered that the JAAS component of OpenJDK did not use the correct way to extract user DN from the result of the user search LDAP query. A specially crafted user LDAP entry could cause the application to use an incorrect DN. (CVE-2017-3252) * It was discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK failed to properly parse user info from the URL. A remote attacker could cause a Java application to incorrectly parse an attacker supplied URL and interpret it differently from other applications processing the same URL. (CVE-2016-5552) * Multiple flaws were found in the Networking components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-3261, CVE-2017-3231) * A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183) This update mitigates the CVE-2016-2183 issue by adding 3DES cipher suites to the list of legacy algorithms (defined using the jdk.tls.legacyAlgorithms security property) so they are only used if connecting TLS/SSL client and server do not share any other non-legacy cipher suite.

An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10285, CVE-2017-10346) * It was discovered that the Kerberos client implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK used the sname field from the plain text part rather than encrypted part of the KDC reply message. A man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this flaw to impersonate Kerberos services to Java applications acting as Kerberos clients. (CVE-2017-10388) * It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK generated weak password-based encryption keys used to protect private keys stored in key stores. This made it easier to perform password guessing attacks to decrypt stored keys if an attacker could gain access to a key store. (CVE-2017-10356) * A flaw was found in the Smart Card IO component in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-10274) * It was found that the FtpClient implementation in the Networking component of OpenJDK did not set connect and read timeouts by default. A malicious FTP server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to block execution of a Java application connecting to an FTP server. (CVE-2017-10355) * It was found that the HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection classes in the Networking component of OpenJDK failed to check for newline characters embedded in URLs. An attacker able to make a Java application perform an HTTP request using an attacker provided URL could possibly inject additional headers into the request. (CVE-2017-10295) * It was discovered that multiple classes in the JAXP, Serialization, Libraries, and JAX-WS components of OpenJDK did not limit the amount of memory allocated when creating object instances from the serialized form. A specially-crafted input could cause a Java application to use an excessive amount of memory when deserialized.

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check arguments of the System.arraycopy() function in certain cases. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to corrupt virtual machine's memory and completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5582) * It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check received Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to send debugging commands to a Java program running with debugging enabled if they could make victim's browser send HTTP requests to the JDWP port of the debugged application. (CVE-2016-5573) * It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not restrict the set of algorithms used for Jar integrity verification. This flaw could allow an attacker to modify content of the Jar file that used weak signing key or hash algorithm. (CVE-2016-5542) Note: After this update, MD2 hash algorithm and RSA keys with less than 1024 bits are no longer allowed to be used for Jar integrity verification by default. MD5 hash algorithm is expected to be disabled by default in the future updates. A newly introduced security property jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms can be used to control the set of disabled algorithms. * A flaw was found in the way the JMX component of OpenJDK handled classloaders. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2016-5554) * A flaw was found in the way the Networking component of OpenJDK handled HTTP proxy authentication. A Java application could possibly expose HTTPS server authentication credentials via a plain text network connection to an HTTP proxy if proxy asked for authentication. (CVE-2016-5597) Note: After this update, Basic HTTP proxy authentication can no longer be used when tunneling HTTPS connection through an HTTP proxy. Newly introduced system properties jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes and jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes can be used to control which authentication schemes can be requested by an HTTP proxy when proxying HTTP and HTTPS connections respectively.

Security Fix(es): * Multiple flaws were found in the Hotspot and AWT components of OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-2582, CVE-2018-2641) * It was discovered that the LDAPCertStore class in the JNDI component of OpenJDK failed to securely handle LDAP referrals. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to make it fetch attacker controlled certificate data. (CVE-2018-2633) * The JGSS component of OpenJDK ignores the value of the javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly property when using HTTP/SPNEGO authentication and always uses global credentials. It was discovered that this could cause global credentials to be unexpectedly used by an untrusted Java application. (CVE-2018-2634) * It was discovered that the JMX component of OpenJDK failed to properly set the deserialization filter for the SingleEntryRegistry in certain cases. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass intended deserialization restrictions. (CVE-2018-2637) * It was discovered that the LDAP component of OpenJDK failed to properly encode special characters in user names when adding them to an LDAP search query. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to manipulate LDAP queries performed by the LdapLoginModule class. (CVE-2018-2588) * It was discovered that the DNS client implementation in the JNDI component of OpenJDK did not use random source ports when sending out DNS queries. This could make it easier for a remote attacker to spoof responses to those queries. (CVE-2018-2599) * It was discovered that the I18n component of OpenJDK could use an untrusted search path when loading resource bundle classes. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as another local user by making their Java application load an attacker controlled class file. (CVE-2018-2602) * It was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK failed to sufficiently limit the amount of memory allocated when reading DER encoded input. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a Java application use an excessive amount of memory if it parsed attacker supplied DER encoded input. (CVE-2018-2603) * It was discovered that the key agreement implementations in the JCE component of OpenJDK did not guarantee sufficient strength of used keys to adequately protect generated shared secret. This could make it easier to break data encryption by attacking key agreement rather than the encryption using the negotiated secret. (CVE-2018-2618) * It was discovered that the JGSS component of OpenJDK failed to properly handle GSS context in the native GSS library wrapper in certain cases. A remote attacker could possibly make a Java application using JGSS to use a previously freed context. (CVE-2018-2629) * It was discovered that multiple classes in the Libraries, AWT, and JNDI components of OpenJDK did not sufficiently validate input when creating object instances from the serialized form. A specially-crafted input could cause a Java application to create objects with an inconsistent state or use an excessive amount of memory when deserialized. (CVE-2018-2663, CVE-2018-2677, CVE-2018-2678) * It was discovered that multiple encryption key classes in the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not properly synchronize access to their internal data. This could possibly cause a multi-threaded Java application to apply weak encryption to data because of the use of a key that was zeroed out.

Security Fix(es): * An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639) Note: This is the OpenJDK side of the CVE-2018-3639 mitigation. Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting this issue.</div>

                                                <div>The java-1.8.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 8 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 8 Java Software Development Kit. Security Fix(es): * An untrusted library search path flaw was found in the JCE component of OpenJDK. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause a Java application using JCE to load an attacker-controlled library and hence escalate their privileges. (CVE-2017-3511) * It was found that the JAXP component of OpenJDK failed to correctly enforce parse tree size limits when parsing XML document. An attacker able to make a Java application parse a specially crafted XML document could use this flaw to make it consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2017-3526) * It was discovered that the HTTP client implementation in the Networking component of OpenJDK could cache and re-use an NTLM authenticated connection in a different security context. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a Java application perform HTTP requests authenticated with credentials of a different user. (CVE-2017-3509) Note: This update adds support for the "jdk.ntlm.cache" system property which, when set to false, prevents caching of NTLM connections and authentications and hence prevents this issue. However, caching remains enabled by default. * It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not allow users to restrict the set of algorithms allowed for Jar integrity verification. This flaw could allow an attacker to modify content of the Jar file that used weak signing key or hash algorithm. (CVE-2017-3539) Note: This updates extends the fix for CVE-2016-5542 released as part of the RHSA-2016:2079 erratum to no longer allow the MD5 hash algorithm during the Jar integrity verification by adding it to the jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms security property. * Newline injection flaws were discovered in FTP and SMTP client implementations in the Networking component in OpenJDK. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to manipulate FTP or SMTP connections established by a Java application. (CVE-2017-3533, CVE-2017-3544) Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website. Bug Fix(es): * When a method is called using the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) "invokeMethod" command in a target Java virtual machine, JDWP creates global references for every Object that is implied in the method invocation, as well as for the returned argument of the reference type. Previously, the global references created for such arguments were not collected (deallocated) by the garbage collector after "invokeMethod" finished. This consequently caused memory leaks, and because references to such objects were never released, the debugged application could be terminated with an Out of Memory error. This bug has been fixed, and the described problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1442162)</div>

Note: If the web browser plug-in provided by the icedtea-web package was installed, the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website. Bug Fix(es): * This update applies changes from OpenJDK upstream version 8u172, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version, 8u171. (BZ#1588364) * OpenJDK was recently updated to support reading the system certificate authority database (cacerts) directly. As an unintended consequence, this removed the ability to read certificates from the user-provided jssecacerts file. With this update, that ability is restored by reading from that file first, if available. (BZ#1593737)</div>

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed configuration file /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-5425) * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed certain configuration files read by the Tomcat initialization script as writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-6325) * It was found that the expression language resolver evaluated expressions within a privileged code section. A malicious web application could use this flaw to bypass security manager protections. (CVE-2014-7810) * It was discovered that tomcat used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5388) * A session fixation flaw was found in the way Tomcat recycled the requestedSessionSSL field. If at least one web application was configured to use the SSL session ID as the HTTP session ID, an attacker could reuse a previously used session ID for further requests. (CVE-2015-5346) Red Hat would like to thank Dawid Golunski (http://legalhackers.com) for reporting CVE-2016-5425 and Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting CVE-2016-5388.

(CVE-2017-5647) * Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Tomcat where if a servlet context was configured with readonly=false and HTTP PUT requests were allowed, an attacker could upload a JSP file to that context and achieve code execution. (CVE-2017-12615, CVE-2017-12617) * A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat where the CORS Filter did not send a "Vary: Origin" HTTP header. This potentially allowed sensitive data to be leaked to other visitors through both client-side and server-side caches. (CVE-2017-7674)</div>

It was found that a fix for a previous security flaw introduced a regression that could cause a denial of service in Tomcat 7. A remote attacker could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of CPU on the Tomcat server by sending a specially crafted request to that server. (CVE-2014-0186) It was found that when Tomcat 7 processed a series of HTTP requests in which at least one request contained either multiple content-length headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding header, Tomcat would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests. (CVE-2013-4286) It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a denial of service flaw in the way Tomcat 7 processed chunk extensions and trailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could consume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Note that chunked transfer encoding is enabled by default. (CVE-2013-4322) All Tomcat 7 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own. (CVE-2016-6816) Note: This fix causes Tomcat to respond with an HTTP 400 Bad Request error when request contains characters that are not permitted by the HTTP specification to appear not encoded, even though they were previously accepted. The newly introduced system property tomcat.util.http.parser.HttpParser.requestTargetAllow can be used to configure Tomcat to accept curly braces ({ and }) and the pipe symbol (|) in not encoded form, as these are often used in URLs without being properly encoded.  * A bug was discovered in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector. This led to the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times allowing information leakage between requests including, and not limited to, session ID and the response body.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: tomcat (7.0.69). (BZ#1287928) Security Fix(es): * A CSRF flaw was found in Tomcat's the index pages for the Manager and Host Manager applications. These applications included a valid CSRF token when issuing a redirect as a result of an unauthenticated request to the root of the web application. This token could then be used by an attacker to perform a CSRF attack. (CVE-2015-5351) * It was found that several Tomcat session persistence mechanisms could allow a remote, authenticated user to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and execute arbitrary code in a privileged context via a web application that placed a crafted object in a session. (CVE-2016-0714) * A security manager bypass flaw was found in Tomcat that could allow remote, authenticated users to access arbitrary application data, potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0763) * A denial of service vulnerability was identified in Commons FileUpload that occurred when the length of the multipart boundary was just below the size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file if the boundary was the typical tens of bytes long. (CVE-2016-3092) * A directory traversal flaw was found in Tomcat's RequestUtil.java. A remote, authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and list a parent directory via a '/..' in a pathname used by a web application in a getResource, getResourceAsStream, or getResourcePaths call. (CVE-2015-5174) * It was found that Tomcat could reveal the presence of a directory even when that directory was protected by a security constraint. A user could make a request to a directory via a URL not ending with a slash and, depending on whether Tomcat redirected that request, could confirm whether that directory existed. (CVE-2015-5345) * It was found that Tomcat allowed the StatusManagerServlet to be loaded by a web application when a security manager was configured. This allowed a web application to list all deployed web applications and expose sensitive information such as session IDs.

It was discovered that Apache Tomcat did not limit the length of chunk sizes when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial of service attack against Tomcat by streaming an unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server resources. (CVE-2014-0075) It was found that Apache Tomcat did not check for overflowing values when parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a Tomcat server located behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header correctly. (CVE-2014-0099) It was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet implementation in Apache Tomcat allowed the definition of XML External Entities (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this to circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive information.

It was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by Apache Tomcat to process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities and/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications deployed on the same Apache Tomcat instance. (CVE-2014-0119) All Tomcat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.</div>

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: tomcat (7.0.76). (BZ#1414895) Security Fix(es): * The Realm implementations did not process the supplied password if the supplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration includes the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability harder. (CVE-2016-0762) * It was discovered that a malicious web application could bypass a configured SecurityManager via a Tomcat utility method that was accessible to web applications. (CVE-2016-5018) * It was discovered that when a SecurityManager was configured, Tomcat's system property replacement feature for configuration files could be used by a malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager and read system properties that should not be visible. (CVE-2016-6794) * It was discovered that a malicious web application could bypass a configured SecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration parameters for the JSP Servlet. (CVE-2016-6796) * It was discovered that it was possible for a web application to access any global JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been configured or not.

Security Fix(es): * An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.

Security Fix(es): * Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimisation) in combination with handling of page-faults caused by terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646) * An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions past bounds check. The flaw relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code and the fact that memory writes occur to an address which depends on the untrusted value. Such writes cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to influence speculative execution and/or read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3693) * A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390) * kernel: crypto: privilege escalation in skcipher_recvmsg function (CVE-2017-13215) * kernel: mm: use-after-free in do_get_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675) * kernel: race condition in snd_seq_write() may lead to UAF or OOB access (CVE-2018-7566) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Security Fix(es): * An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's networking subsystem processed TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) segments. While processing SACK segments, the Linux kernel's socket buffer (SKB) data structure becomes fragmented. Each fragment is about TCP maximum segment size (MSS) bytes. To efficiently process SACK blocks, the Linux kernel merges multiple fragmented SKBs into one, potentially overflowing the variable holding the number of segments. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the Linux kernel by sending a crafted sequence of SACK segments on a TCP connection with small value of TCP MSS, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). (CVE-2019-11477) * Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption while processing SACK blocks allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11478) * Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption for TCP connections with low MSS allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11479) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.</div>

                                                <div>The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system. Security Fix(es): An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited. Note: This issue is present in hardware and cannot be fully fixed via software update. The updated kernel packages provide software mitigation for this hardware issue at a cost of potential performance penalty. Please refer to References section for further information about this issue and the performance impact. In this update initial mitigations for IBM Power (PowerPC) and IBM zSeries (S390) architectures are provided. * Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. This fix specifically addresses S390 processors. (CVE-2017-5715, Important) * Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. This fix specifically addresses S390 and PowerPC processors. (CVE-2017-5753, Important) * Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. Note: CVE-2017-5754 affects Intel x86-64 microprocessors. AMD x86-64 microprocessors are not affected by this issue. This fix specifically addresses PowerPC processors. (CVE-2017-5754, Important) Red Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753, and CVE-2017-5754.

                                                <div>The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system. Security Fix(es): * A flaw was found in the implementation of the "fill buffer", a mechanism used by modern CPUs when a cache-miss is made on L1 CPU cache.  If an attacker can generate a load operation that would create a page fault, the execution will continue speculatively with incorrect data from the fill buffer while the data is fetched from higher level caches.  This response time can be measured to infer data in the fill buffer. (CVE-2018-12130) * Modern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level micro-optimizations to improve the performance of writing data back to CPU caches. The write operation is split into STA (STore Address) and STD (STore Data) sub-operations. These sub-operations allow the processor to hand-off address generation logic into these sub-operations for optimized writes. Both of these sub-operations write to a shared distributed processor structure called the 'processor store buffer'.  As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read private data resident within the CPU's processor store buffer. (CVE-2018-12126) * Microprocessors use a ‘load port’ subcomponent to perform load operations from memory or IO. During a load operation, the load port receives data from the memory or IO subsystem and then provides the data to the CPU registers and operations in the CPU’s pipelines. Stale load operations results are stored in the 'load port' table until overwritten by newer operations. Certain load-port operations triggered by an attacker can be used to reveal data about previous stale requests leaking data back to the attacker via a timing side-channel. (CVE-2018-12127) * Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access.

                                                <div>The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system. Security Fix(es): An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited. Note: This issue is present in hardware and cannot be fully fixed via software update. The updated kernel packages provide software mitigation for this hardware issue at a cost of potential performance penalty. Please refer to References section for further information about this issue and the performance impact. In this update mitigations for x86-64 architecture are provided. Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5753, Important) Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5715, Important) Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5754, Important) Note: CVE-2017-5754 affects Intel x86-64 microprocessors. AMD x86-64 microprocessors are not affected by this issue.

Security Fix(es): * A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. An unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-5195, Important) * Linux kernel built with the 802.1Q/802.1ad VLAN(CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q) OR Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network(CONFIG_VXLAN) with Transparent Ethernet Bridging(TEB) GRO support, is vulnerable to a stack overflow issue. It could occur while receiving large packets via GRO path, as an unlimited recursion could unfold in both VLAN and TEB modules, leading to a stack corruption in the kernel. (CVE-2016-7039, Important) Red Hat would like to thank Phil Oester for reporting CVE-2016-5195. Bug Fix(es): * Previously, the operating system did not support the Mellanox ConnectX-4 PCIe Network Interface Controllers (NIC) in Ethernet mode. This update enables Ethernet support in the mlx5 driver. As a result, the Mellanox ConnectX-4 PCIe NICs now work in Ethernet mode as expected. (BZ#1413108) * On the Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies server platform with Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies Centriq 2400 CPU (QDF2400v1) memory accesses sometimes allocated Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) entries using an incorrect Address Space ID (ASID). This could consequently result in memory corruption and crashes under certain conditions. The underlying source code has been modified to handle the TTBRx_EL1[ASID] and TTBRx_EL1[BADDR] fields separately using a reserved ASID, and the described problem no longer occurs. (BZ#1421765)</div>

Security Fix(es): * A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs, logged the buffer descriptors during migration.

Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. Security Fix(es): * A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183) Note: This update modifies the Python ssl module to disable 3DES cipher suites by default. Red Hat would like to thank OpenVPN for reporting this issue.

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed configuration file /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-5425) * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed certain configuration files read by the Tomcat initialization script as writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-6325) * It was found that the expression language resolver evaluated expressions within a privileged code section. A malicious web application could use this flaw to bypass security manager protections. (CVE-2014-7810) * It was discovered that tomcat used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5388) * A session fixation flaw was found in the way Tomcat recycled the requestedSessionSSL field. If at least one web application was configured to use the SSL session ID as the HTTP session ID, an attacker could reuse a previously used session ID for further requests. (CVE-2015-5346) Red Hat would like to thank Dawid Golunski (http://legalhackers.com) for reporting CVE-2016-5425 and Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting CVE-2016-5388.

(CVE-2017-5647) * Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Tomcat where if a servlet context was configured with readonly=false and HTTP PUT requests were allowed, an attacker could upload a JSP file to that context and achieve code execution. (CVE-2017-12615, CVE-2017-12617) * A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat where the CORS Filter did not send a "Vary: Origin" HTTP header. This potentially allowed sensitive data to be leaked to other visitors through both client-side and server-side caches. (CVE-2017-7674)</div>

It was found that a fix for a previous security flaw introduced a regression that could cause a denial of service in Tomcat 7. A remote attacker could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of CPU on the Tomcat server by sending a specially crafted request to that server. (CVE-2014-0186) It was found that when Tomcat 7 processed a series of HTTP requests in which at least one request contained either multiple content-length headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding header, Tomcat would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests. (CVE-2013-4286) It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a denial of service flaw in the way Tomcat 7 processed chunk extensions and trailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could consume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Note that chunked transfer encoding is enabled by default. (CVE-2013-4322) All Tomcat 7 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own. (CVE-2016-6816) Note: This fix causes Tomcat to respond with an HTTP 400 Bad Request error when request contains characters that are not permitted by the HTTP specification to appear not encoded, even though they were previously accepted. The newly introduced system property tomcat.util.http.parser.HttpParser.requestTargetAllow can be used to configure Tomcat to accept curly braces ({ and }) and the pipe symbol (|) in not encoded form, as these are often used in URLs without being properly encoded.  * A bug was discovered in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector. This led to the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times allowing information leakage between requests including, and not limited to, session ID and the response body.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: tomcat (7.0.69). (BZ#1287928) Security Fix(es): * A CSRF flaw was found in Tomcat's the index pages for the Manager and Host Manager applications. These applications included a valid CSRF token when issuing a redirect as a result of an unauthenticated request to the root of the web application. This token could then be used by an attacker to perform a CSRF attack. (CVE-2015-5351) * It was found that several Tomcat session persistence mechanisms could allow a remote, authenticated user to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and execute arbitrary code in a privileged context via a web application that placed a crafted object in a session. (CVE-2016-0714) * A security manager bypass flaw was found in Tomcat that could allow remote, authenticated users to access arbitrary application data, potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0763) * A denial of service vulnerability was identified in Commons FileUpload that occurred when the length of the multipart boundary was just below the size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file if the boundary was the typical tens of bytes long. (CVE-2016-3092) * A directory traversal flaw was found in Tomcat's RequestUtil.java. A remote, authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and list a parent directory via a '/..' in a pathname used by a web application in a getResource, getResourceAsStream, or getResourcePaths call. (CVE-2015-5174) * It was found that Tomcat could reveal the presence of a directory even when that directory was protected by a security constraint. A user could make a request to a directory via a URL not ending with a slash and, depending on whether Tomcat redirected that request, could confirm whether that directory existed. (CVE-2015-5345) * It was found that Tomcat allowed the StatusManagerServlet to be loaded by a web application when a security manager was configured. This allowed a web application to list all deployed web applications and expose sensitive information such as session IDs.

It was discovered that Apache Tomcat did not limit the length of chunk sizes when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial of service attack against Tomcat by streaming an unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server resources. (CVE-2014-0075) It was found that Apache Tomcat did not check for overflowing values when parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a Tomcat server located behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header correctly. (CVE-2014-0099) It was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet implementation in Apache Tomcat allowed the definition of XML External Entities (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this to circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive information.

It was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by Apache Tomcat to process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities and/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications deployed on the same Apache Tomcat instance. (CVE-2014-0119) All Tomcat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.</div>

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: tomcat (7.0.76). (BZ#1414895) Security Fix(es): * The Realm implementations did not process the supplied password if the supplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration includes the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability harder. (CVE-2016-0762) * It was discovered that a malicious web application could bypass a configured SecurityManager via a Tomcat utility method that was accessible to web applications. (CVE-2016-5018) * It was discovered that when a SecurityManager was configured, Tomcat's system property replacement feature for configuration files could be used by a malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager and read system properties that should not be visible. (CVE-2016-6794) * It was discovered that a malicious web application could bypass a configured SecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration parameters for the JSP Servlet. (CVE-2016-6796) * It was discovered that it was possible for a web application to access any global JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been configured or not.

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed configuration file /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-5425) * It was discovered that the Tomcat packages installed certain configuration files read by the Tomcat initialization script as writeable to the tomcat group. A member of the group or a malicious web application deployed on Tomcat could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-6325) * It was found that the expression language resolver evaluated expressions within a privileged code section. A malicious web application could use this flaw to bypass security manager protections. (CVE-2014-7810) * It was discovered that tomcat used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5388) * A session fixation flaw was found in the way Tomcat recycled the requestedSessionSSL field. If at least one web application was configured to use the SSL session ID as the HTTP session ID, an attacker could reuse a previously used session ID for further requests. (CVE-2015-5346) Red Hat would like to thank Dawid Golunski (http://legalhackers.com) for reporting CVE-2016-5425 and Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting CVE-2016-5388.

If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647) * Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Tomcat where if a servlet context was configured with readonly=false and HTTP PUT requests were allowed, an attacker could upload a JSP file to that context and achieve code execution. (CVE-2017-12615, CVE-2017-12617) * A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat where the CORS Filter did not send a "Vary: Origin" HTTP header. This potentially allowed sensitive data to be leaked to other visitors through both client-side and server-side caches. (CVE-2017-7674)</div>

It was found that a fix for a previous security flaw introduced a regression that could cause a denial of service in Tomcat 7. A remote attacker could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of CPU on the Tomcat server by sending a specially crafted request to that server. (CVE-2014-0186) It was found that when Tomcat 7 processed a series of HTTP requests in which at least one request contained either multiple content-length headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding header, Tomcat would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests. (CVE-2013-4286) It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a denial of service flaw in the way Tomcat 7 processed chunk extensions and trailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could consume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Note that chunked transfer encoding is enabled by default. (CVE-2013-4322) All Tomcat 7 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.</div>

Security Fix(es): * It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own. (CVE-2016-6816) Note: This fix causes Tomcat to respond with an HTTP 400 Bad Request error when request contains characters that are not permitted by the HTTP specification to appear not encoded, even though they were previously accepted. The newly introduced system property tomcat.util.http.parser.HttpParser.requestTargetAllow can be used to configure Tomcat to accept curly braces ({ and }) and the pipe symbol (|) in not encoded form, as these are often used in URLs without being properly encoded.  * A bug was discovered in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector. This led to the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times allowing information leakage between requests including, and not limited to, session ID and the response body.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: tomcat (7.0.69). (BZ#1287928) Security Fix(es): * A CSRF flaw was found in Tomcat's the index pages for the Manager and Host Manager applications. These applications included a valid CSRF token when issuing a redirect as a result of an unauthenticated request to the root of the web application. This token could then be used by an attacker to perform a CSRF attack. (CVE-2015-5351) * It was found that several Tomcat session persistence mechanisms could allow a remote, authenticated user to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and execute arbitrary code in a privileged context via a web application that placed a crafted object in a session. (CVE-2016-0714) * A security manager bypass flaw was found in Tomcat that could allow remote, authenticated users to access arbitrary application data, potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0763) * A denial of service vulnerability was identified in Commons FileUpload that occurred when the length of the multipart boundary was just below the size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file if the boundary was the typical tens of bytes long. (CVE-2016-3092) * A directory traversal flaw was found in Tomcat's RequestUtil.java. A remote, authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and list a parent directory via a '/..' in a pathname used by a web application in a getResource, getResourceAsStream, or getResourcePaths call. (CVE-2015-5174) * It was found that Tomcat could reveal the presence of a directory even when that directory was protected by a security constraint. A user could make a request to a directory via a URL not ending with a slash and, depending on whether Tomcat redirected that request, could confirm whether that directory existed. (CVE-2015-5345) * It was found that Tomcat allowed the StatusManagerServlet to be loaded by a web application when a security manager was configured. This allowed a web application to list all deployed web applications and expose sensitive information such as session IDs.

It was discovered that Apache Tomcat did not limit the length of chunk sizes when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial of service attack against Tomcat by streaming an unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server resources. (CVE-2014-0075) It was found that Apache Tomcat did not check for overflowing values when parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a Tomcat server located behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header correctly. (CVE-2014-0099) It was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet implementation in Apache Tomcat allowed the definition of XML External Entities (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this to circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0096) The CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security. All Tomcat 7 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.</div>

It was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by Apache Tomcat to process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities and/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications deployed on the same Apache Tomcat instance.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: tomcat (7.0.76). (BZ#1414895) Security Fix(es): * The Realm implementations did not process the supplied password if the supplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration includes the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability harder. (CVE-2016-0762) * It was discovered that a malicious web application could bypass a configured SecurityManager via a Tomcat utility method that was accessible to web applications. (CVE-2016-5018) * It was discovered that when a SecurityManager was configured, Tomcat's system property replacement feature for configuration files could be used by a malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager and read system properties that should not be visible. (CVE-2016-6794) * It was discovered that a malicious web application could bypass a configured SecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration parameters for the JSP Servlet. (CVE-2016-6796) * It was discovered that it was possible for a web application to access any global JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been configured or not.

Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. Security Fix(es): * A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183) Note: This update modifies the Python ssl module to disable 3DES cipher suites by default. Red Hat would like to thank OpenVPN for reporting this issue.
